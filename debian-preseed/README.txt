#################

Those scripts are pure experimentation currently. The script was design to 
work on debian 7 only. Don't work on somewhere else:

  curl URL_TO_SCRIPT/slapos-quick-install.sh | EMAIL=YYYY COMPUTERNAME=XXXX sh -

The preseed script will be used only to quickly automate debian installation. So, 
it should not automatically install slapos for the moment.
