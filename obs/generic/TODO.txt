SHORT TERM
Document the project.
Do not rename the plugin library (libfluentbit-wendelin.so to fluentbit-wendelin.so). The fix first has to be made upstream (in the metadata-collect-agent project).

MID TERM
Add a fonction in build-scripts/configuration-information.sh to delete the go/ directory?
Re-add networkcached to the building process.
Use a ./configure script?
- In particular, in $ARCHIVE_NAME/Makefile there are some operations which should be in the template stage.
Make the clean_* suite reversible.
Write tests to test the compilation and the reversibility with clean_*.

LONG RUN
Write standards to that other people can adapt the project without breaking it.
