SHORT RUN
"Merge" BUILD_DIR and RUN_BUILDOUT_DIR. Don't forgot the templates.
In Makefile.in, allow to select some parts to copy.
Set the versions to 1-1 instead of 0-1?

LONG RUN
Use a ./configure script?
In particular, in $ARCHIVE_NAME/Makefile there are some operations which should be in the template stage.
